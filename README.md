# Data Structures and Algorithms

## 📖 Introduction

Welcome to the **Data Structures and Algorithms** repository! This project serves as a comprehensive collection of fundamental and advanced data structures and algorithms implementations. Whether you're a student learning the basics, a developer preparing for technical interviews, or someone looking to refresh their knowledge, this repository provides clear, well-documented code examples.

## 🎯 Purpose

The primary goals of this repository are to:

- Provide clear and efficient implementations of common data structures and algorithms
- Serve as a learning resource for computer science fundamentals
- Help developers prepare for technical interviews and coding challenges
- Demonstrate best practices in code organization and documentation
- Foster understanding of algorithmic complexity and performance optimization

## ✨ Main Features

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Implementations of essential data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, hash tables, etc.)
- **Algorithm Variety**: Sorting, searching, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and more
- **Well-Documented Code**: Each implementation includes comments and explanations
- **Complexity Analysis**: Time and space complexity documented for each algorithm
- **Modular Design**: Clean, reusable code that follows software engineering best practices
- **Regular Updates**: Continuously expanding collection of implementations

## 🛠️ Technologies

This repository primarily uses:

- **Programming Language**: [Add primary language(s) used - e.g., Python, Java, C++, JavaScript]
- **Development Tools**: [Add any specific IDEs or tools recommended]
- **Testing Framework**: [Add if applicable - e.g., JUnit, pytest, Jest]

## 🚀 Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Add specific version requirements - e.g., Python 3.8+, Java 11+, etc.]
- Git installed on your local machine
- [Any other dependencies]

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sachethanv/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
   ```

3. [Add any additional setup steps - e.g., install dependencies, compile code, etc.]

## 💻 Usage

Each data structure and algorithm is organized in its own directory with:

- Implementation file(s)
- Example usage
- Test cases (where applicable)
- Documentation

To run a specific implementation:

```bash
[Add example command - e.g., python3 sorting/quick_sort.py]
```

### Example

```python
# Example code snippet showing how to use an implementation
[Add relevant example]
```
